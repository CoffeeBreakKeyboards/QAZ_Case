# QAZ_Case

Here is the P3D QAZ Case derived from dingusxmcgee_#1691 's Simple QAZ Case from the [40% Discord](https://discord.gg/GJqv7hz)

-All CAD, the STL file, and the .dxf for cutting is supplied.

-As with dingusxmcgee's QAZ-Simple, standoffs are needed to use this case with current sales of QAZ PCB. M2x10mm standoffs are needed for builds with a plate, plateless builds need M2x5mm standoffs and M2 washers.

-8x M2x8mm screws are needed to attach the QAZ PCB to the standoffs through the acrylic bottom.

-M2x8mm self tapping screws are needed to attach the acrylic bottom to the printed case shell. They are available at [McMaster](https://www.mcmaster.com/99397A269/)

-The design is based on 1/8" thick acrylic, but 3mm will work as well as <3mm thick metals cut through sendcutsend for example
